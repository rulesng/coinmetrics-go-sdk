# coinmetrics-go-sdk

https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4#tag/Timeseries

At the start only interested in End Of Day data for one exchange (example: bitcoin price from Coinbase). This should go back up to 5 years

I need a Go client package built for the Coin Metrics API.

The package should be tagged, have documentation, and be installable using go get.

The package should have very good unit testing (over 90%) and expose all functionality from the API, starting with historical timeseries data.

API documentation is here: https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api/v4

More API information: https://docs.coinmetrics.io/api

Python client for reference is here: https://github.com/coinmetrics/api-client-python
